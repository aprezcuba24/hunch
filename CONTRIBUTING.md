# Contribution Guide

Considering contributing? Thank you so much!

There's a [test framework](./test/README.md) that should be pretty straightforward, one thing that HunchJS could always use more of are thoughtful tests for the different features!

Please consider these simple guidelines when filing a pull request:

* Make pull requests to the `main` branch.
* Features and bug fixes should be covered by test cases. (If you find a bug and don't know how to write a test, that's okay, file anyway and we can learn together!)
* Commits should follow the [Angular commit convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines) but just try your best and it can be sorted out later!
* It should be automatically configured via [.editorconfig](.editorconfig), but use [tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment](https://gist.github.com/saibotsivad/06021a81865226cfc140)
